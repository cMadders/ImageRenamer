# ImageRenamer

# Summary
This was the first program I ever wrote, outside of standard exercises.

It began as a simple production task performer to automate small portions of my job at the time.  Initially the program would separate relevant portions of text from documents and save them into individual .txt files.

I began adding more functionality, one function at a time.  By the end, it would parse a document for relevant information, create excel files, creating and renaming images to match naming conventions and database entry, multiple levels of error checking, and creating files used for video production.  Since it was a program of my own design, it had to adapt to the current production process, which required sub-optimal methods occasionally.

# Note
This program is largely unedited since it was initially made.  There are things I would have done differently and it was before I was introduced to pattern matching and regular expressions.

# Use
To initiate the program, compile and run ImageRenamer.java.  The supporting libraries are not included in the GIT repository.
